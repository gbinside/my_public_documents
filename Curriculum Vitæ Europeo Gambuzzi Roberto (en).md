As a "one-man team" I designed, developed and deployed, on the server I was maintaining, an application to keep track of maintenance jobs on [ENI](http://www.eni.com/)'s fuel stations, using a mix of technologies, including mobile application, web portals, ocr, webservice on our side and on ENI's side. The application gathered data via [Anoto digital paper](http://www.anoto.com/) technology (specifically using the AFS project)  and trasmitted the data via a mobile phone to a OCR server ([Readsoft](http://www.readsoft.com/)), automatically inserted into a Mysql DB. In case of compilation errors, the related modules were manually checked. In the last step the data were sent to ENI's server. The process included several helper web applications, written in Python with cherrypy and in C#, which kept track or consulted the data involved in the process.
